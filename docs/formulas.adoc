* Velocity of y
    - stem:[\Deltay = V_{0}t + 1/2at^2]

* Velocity of x
    - stem:[\Deltax = V_{0}t]

* Angle of trojectory
    - stem:[\theta = \arctan(frac{opposite}{adjactent})]

* Getting initial y velocity (going downward increases in value)
    - stem:[y_{0} = -l_0 * \sin(\theta)]

* Getting initial x velocity 
    - stem:[x_{0} = l_0 * \cos(\theta)]

NOTE: launch_initial is just an intial, almost arbitrary, value. It is just a
      distance the launch pad is from the mouse and is used to control the
      amount of velocity you want.
